  <title>Hardware Deployment and Wiring</title>
  
  <body>
  <p> Please follow the steps below to deploy hardware and wiring reference: </p>
  
  <p>
  <ol>
<li>	Check BIOS setting of each compute node, and make sure that “SRIOV Global Enable” is “Enables”.</li>
<li>	In BIOS, under “Processor Settings”, “Virtualization Technology” flag should be enabled as well.</li>
<li>	Insert Intel ® X520 in P1 slot of compute node 1, as shown below

</li>


<li>    Insert Intel ® X520 in P2 slot of compute node 1, as shown below </li>
<image href="artwork/fig4.png" placement="break"></image>
<li>	Repeat the steps (3) and (4) for compute 2 and 3 as well.</li>

<li>	Now wire the newly added X520s in compute nodes to S6000 leaf switch, following is the reference wiring diagram:

      <p><b>Additional Wiring Notes </b></p>
	      <ol>
    <li>	1x breakout cable will be connected to p1 of Compute Node 1
	
</li>
	<li>1x breakout cable will be connected to p2 of Compute Node 1</li>
	<li>	1x breakout cable will be connected to p1 of Compute Node 2 and 3</li>
     <li>	1x breakout cable will be connected to p2 of Compute Node 2 and 3
</li>
	      </ol> </li>

<li>	Double check the QSFP port coloring for each vendor and document that the solution is only validated against the particular one.</li>

<li>	Connect S4820T switch uplink to external datacenter.
 It is highly recommended to allocate a dedicated 2x10Gbps link between S4820T and external datacenter.</li>

</ol>
